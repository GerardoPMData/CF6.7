Project Description: Global Coral Reef Bleaching Analysis (2010–2019)

This repository contains Python code developed to analyze factors contributing to coral reef bleaching worldwide. The dataset focuses on the most recent years (2010–2019) to uncover key environmental stressors affecting reef health.

By performing geospatial analysis, severe bleaching regions were identified, and statistical methods were applied to assess the impact of climate-related factors. Large-scale datasets were processed and visualized using advanced programming techniques, providing valuable insights into coral reef conservation.

Key Skills & Techniques: Geospatial analysis and mapping, Statistical assessment of environmental stressors, Data visualization of large-scale datasets, Advanced programming techniques for ecological research.
